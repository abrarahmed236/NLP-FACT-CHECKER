# NLP-FACT-CHECKER
Project Report


To solve this problem we willl be using semantic similarity between the documents and the fact.

Steps we will implement for computing semantic similarity between two sentences:
  • First each sentence is partitioned into a list of tokens.
  • Part-of-speech disambiguation (or tagging).
  • Stemming words.
  • Find the most appropriate sense for every word in a sentence (Word Sense Disambiguation).
  • Finally, compute the similarity of the sentences based on the similarity of the pairs of words.
